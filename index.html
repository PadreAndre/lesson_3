                A brilliant blast from a galaxy 2 billion light-years away is the brightest cosmic “Cow” found yet. It's
                the fifth known object in this new class of exploding stars and their long-glowing remnants, and it's
                giving astronomers even more hints of what powers these mysterious blasts.

                    These Cow-like events, named for the first such object discovered in 2018 — which had the unique
                    identifier name of AT2018cow — are a subclass of supernova explosions, making up only 0.1 percent of
                    such cosmic blasts (SN: 6/21/19). <span> They brighten quickly, glow brilliantly in ultraviolet and
                        blue

                    Unraveling all that took a bit of time. The Zwicky Transient Facility at Caltech's Palomar
                    Observatory near San Diego, Calif., initially noted a bright new burst of light June 12, 2020, but
                    astronomers didn't realize what it was at the time.

                    Then in April 2021, researchers with the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space telescope, which
                    studies X-ray light, alerted Yao and her colleagues to an interesting signal in SRG data from July
                    21–24, 2020, at the same spot in the sky. “I almost immediately realized that this might be another
                    Cow-like event,” says Yao. The astronomers sprang to action and looked at that location with
                    multiple other observatories in different kinds of light.

                    The brightest Cow-like supernova blast yet seen, AT2020mrf, was not visible (empty circle) in
                    January 2020 in X-rays captured by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma space telescope. But in July, it was
                    hard to miss.

                    One of those observatories was the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory, the world's most powerful
                    X-ray telescope. In June 2021, a year after the original supernova blast, it captured X-rays from
                    the
                    same location. The source's signal “was 10 times brighter than what I expected,” says Yao, and 200
                    times
                    as bright as the original Cow was a year post-explosion.<br>

                    Even more exciting was that the strengths of both the Chandra X-ray detection and the original SRG
                    X-ray
                    observations also changed within hours to days. That flaring characteristic, it turns out, can tell
                    astronomers a lot.<br>

                <p class="bottom-text">
                    “X-rays give us information of what's happening at the heart of these events,” says MIT
                    astrophysicist
                    DJ Pasham, who has studied the original Cow but was not part of this new study. “The duration of the
                    flare gives you a sense of how compact or how big the object is.” <br>

                    A compact object like an actively eating black hole or a rapidly spinning and highly magnetic
                    neutron
                    star would create the strong and variable X-ray signals that were seen, Yao says. These were the two
                    most probable leftover remnants of the original cosmic Cow as well, but the AT2020mrf observations
                    provide even greater certainty (SN: 12/13/21).<br>

                    Further observations and catching these objects earlier in the act with multiple types of light will
                    help researchers learn more about this new class of supernovas and what type of star eventually
                    explodes
                    as a Cow. Test linux ssh git<br>
